Starting with version 6 rmtoo is also distributed as a Debian
package. Currently the package is for SQEEZE only.

Documentation is placed under /usr/share/doc/rmtoo

The documentation includes the requirements dependency graph and the
requirements.pdf document from rmtoo itself.

The package also includes the regression and unit tests.
It is possible to run most of them with:
$ cd /usr/share/pyshared/rmtoo
$ nosetests --verbosity=3 --with-coverage --cover-package=rmtoo
(It is not possible to run all, because the version control system
history is missing.)

(nosetest might complain about a '[Errno 13] Permission denied',
because the file '.coverage' cannot be written - this can be ignored.) 

Currently about 93% test coverage is reached with the included tests. 

Happy requirements writing!

The python-central build helper is deprecated and should be
replaced with dh_python2.
